NYC Airbnb Listing AnalysisThis project analyzes Airbnb listing data for New York City to uncover insights into pricing, availability, and geographical distribution. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to understand the factors influencing the Airbnb market in NYC.DatasetThe dataset used in this analysis is datasets.csv, which contains information about Airbnb listings in New York City. The key columns used for this analysis include:id: Listing IDhost_id: Host IDlatitude: Latitude of the listinglongitude: Longitude of the listingprice: Price per nightminimum_nights: Minimum number of nights for a bookingnumber_of_reviews: Total number of reviewsreviews_per_month: Average number of reviews per monthavailability_365: Number of days the listing is available in a yearbeds: Number of bedsneighbourhood_group: Borough of the listing (e.g., Brooklyn, Manhattan)room_type: Type of room (e.g., Private room, Entire home/apt)AnalysisThe analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook (Project_1.ipynb) and includes the following steps:Data Loading and Cleaning: The dataset is loaded using pandas. Null values and duplicate entries are removed to ensure data quality. Data types of columns like id and host_id are converted to appropriate formats.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Univariate Analysis:Distribution of listing prices is examined to understand the price range. A boxplot is used to identify and handle outliers, with a focus on listings under $1500.Distribution of availability_365 is analyzed to see how many listings are available year-round.Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:A new feature, price_per_bed, is created to normalize the price.The relationship between neighbourhood_group, room_type, and price_per_bed is explored using bar plots.The correlation between the number of reviews and the price per bed is visualized with a scatter plot.A heatmap is generated to show the correlation between all numerical variables.Geographical Analysis: A scatter plot of latitude and longitude is used to visualize the geographical distribution of listings across the different neighbourhood groups in NYC.Key FindingsPrice Distribution: The majority of Airbnb listings in NYC are priced under $500 per night, with a significant concentration between $50 and $200.Availability: A large number of listings have high availability throughout the year, suggesting that many are dedicated rental properties.Geographical Insights: Manhattan has the highest average price per bed, especially for entire homes/apartments. Brooklyn follows as the next most expensive borough.Correlations: There is a moderate positive correlation between the price of a listing and the number of beds it offers. Other numerical features show weak correlations with each other.VisualizationsThe notebook includes several visualizations to illustrate the findings:Boxplot of prices to show the distribution and identify outliers.Histograms for price and availability distributions.Bar plot showing the average price per bed by neighbourhood group and room type.Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between price and number of reviews.Pairplot to visualize relationships between key numerical features.Scatter plot showing the geographical locations of listings.Heatmap of the correlation matrix.How to UseClone the repository.Ensure you have Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn installed.Place the datasets.csv file in the same directory as the notebook.Run the Project_1.ipynb notebook to reproduce the analysis.
